# PDF to PDFs

My school's printer only allows me to print 10 pages at a time, everytime the file's name must be different due to the printer's duplicate prevention mechanism. Frusrated by this, I created this program to break down any PDF file into smaller ones, whose page is your choice.


Setting up:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngxuandat/PDF-to-pages-PDFs
```

There are three things you need to do:

1. Locate the location of the desired PDF. Pass it to the program when asked. You should also include ".pdf".
2. Pick the name and where the output file will be. 
3. Choose how many page per small PDF you want.
